# Line above indicates this script must be run by Python


# To run your Python programs, save your .py file to your home folder.
# Then, change the .py fileâ€™s permissions to make it executable by running
# chmod +x pythonScript.py. File permissions are beyond the scope of this book,
# but you will need to run this command on your Python file if you want to
# run the program from the Terminal window. Once you do so, you will be
# able to run your script whenever you want by opening a Terminal window
# and entering ./pythonScript.py. The shebang line at the top of the script will
# tell the operating system where to locate the Python interpreter.
